HoloViews Tutorials
*******************

The HoloViews tutorials are the best way to learn what HoloViews can
do and how to use it.  The web site has static copies of each
tutorial, but it is much more effective to install HoloViews and try
it out live for yourself, using the notebook files in this `zip
archive`_.


Introductory Tutorials
----------------------

These explanatory tutorials are meant to be viewed and worked through
in this order:

* `Showcase: <Showcase>`_
  Brief demonstration of what HoloViews can do for you and your data.

* `Introduction: <Introduction>`_
  How to use HoloViews -- basic concepts and getting started.

* `Exploring Data: <Exploring_Data>`_
  How to use HoloViews containers to flexibly hold all your data
  ready for selecting, sampling, slicing, viewing, combining, and
  animating.

* `Sampling Data: <Sampling_Data>`_
  How to select data in multiple dimensions and begin transforming
  it into different types.


Supplementary Tutorials
------------------------

There are additional tutorials detailing other features of HoloViews:

* `Options: <Options>`_
  Listing and changing the many options that control how HoloViews
  visualizes your objects, from Python or IPython.

* `Exporting: <Exporting>`_
  How to save HoloViews output for use in reports and publications,
  as part of a reproducible yet interactive scientific workflow.

* `Continuous Coordinates: <Continuous_Coordinates>`_
  How to use continuous coordinates to work with real-world data or
  smooth functions.

* `Composing Data: <Composing_Data>`_
  Complete example of the full range of hierarchical, multidimensional
  discrete and continuous data structures supported by HoloViews.

* `Pandas Conversion: <Pandas_Conversion>`_
  Using HoloViews the DFrame conversion wrapper to convert pandas
  dataframes into HoloViews components.

* `Pandas and Seaborn: <Pandas_Seaborn>`_
  Specialized visualizations provided by pandas and seaborn.


Reference Notebooks
-------------------

At any point, you can look through these comprehensive but less
explanatory overview tutorials.  For each of the HoloViews components
available, these tutorials show how to create it, how the objects are
plotted by default, and show how to list and change all of the
visualization options for that object type:

* `Elements: <Elements>`_
  Overview and examples of all HoloViews element types, the atomic items
  that can be combined together.

* `Containers: <Containers>`_
  Overview and examples of all the HoloViews container types.

For more detailed (but less readable!) information on any component
described in these tutorials, please refer to the `Reference Manual
<../Reference_Manual>`_. For further notebooks demonstrating how to
extend HoloViews and apply it to real world data see the `Examples
<../Examples>`_ page.
